## How to start

### 1) Install dependencies

First, you must re-create the `node_modules` folder and install all required third-party dependencies.

This is done via the following command:

```shell
npm install
```

**Important:** You must be navigated into the project folder (inside your terminal / command prompt) before running this command.

### 2) Run the development server

As a next step, you can start the development server via

```shell
npm start
```

or 

```shell
ng serve
```
